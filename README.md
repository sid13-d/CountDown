## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the Countdown project [CountDown](https://count-down-beige.vercel.app/).


# Countdown Project

Welcome to Countdown, a small side project where you can experience the thrill of pressing a button within a specified time limit! This project was created to explore the concepts of refs and portals in React.

## Project Overview

The main functionality of this project involves starting a countdown timer and challenging users to press a button before the timer reaches zero. The project leverages React's refs for efficient interaction with the DOM and uses portals to render components outside the normal React tree.

## Technologies Used

- React: This project is built using React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Vite: The project is initialized and configured using Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.

## Learning Experience

In the process of building this project, I delved into the following concepts:

### Refs in React

Refs in React provide a way to interact with the DOM directly. In this project, refs are used to efficiently handle user input and manipulate the DOM elements associated with the countdown timer and button.

### Portals in React

Portals enable rendering a child component at a different place in the DOM hierarchy. In this project, portals are employed to render the countdown timer outside its parent component, maintaining a clean and organized structure in the React component tree.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/countdown-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd countdown-project
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
